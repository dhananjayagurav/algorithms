'''
John Watson performs an operation called a right circular rotation on an array of integers, . After performing one right circular rotation operation, the array is transformed from to .

Watson performs this operation times. To test Sherlock's ability to identify the current element at a particular position in the rotated array, Watson asks queries, where each query consists of a single integer, , for which you must print the element at index in the rotated array (i.e., the value of ).

Input Format

The first line contains space-separated integers, , , and , respectively.
The second line contains space-separated integers, where each integer describes array element (where ).
Each of the subsequent lines contains a single integer denoting .

Constraints

Output Format

For each query, print the value of the element at index of the rotated array on a new line.
